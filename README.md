JigoShop Software Add-On

This plugin extends the WordPress [JigoShop](http://jigoshop.com/) e-commerce plugin by offering the disabling and enabling certain functionality which transform the shop into a software selling hub, include a full API for license generation, license activation, license retrieval, activation e-mails, stats and more. 

The code is well documented (inline) with more documentation to come. The project started off as a private client request, but is now public for anyone to collaborate on. That being said, the client continues to use this plugin and its updates, and thus there may be certain constraints before pushing an update (otherwise a branch may be required). We are open to any suggestions :)
